# HAT-CL

Redesigned Hard-Attention-to-the-Task for Continual Learning

HAT-CL is a comprehensive reimagining of the Hard-Attention-to-the-Task (HAT) mechanism, designed specifically to combat catastrophic forgetting during Continual Learning (CL). 
Originally proposed in the paper [Overcoming catastrophic forgetting with hard attention to the task](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00796), HAT has been instrumental in enabling neural networks to learn successive tasks without erasure of prior knowledge. 
However, the original implementation had its drawbacks, notably incompatibility with PyTorch's optimizers and the requirement for manual gradient manipulation.
HAT-CL aims to rectify these issues with a user-friendly design and a host of new features:

- Seamless compatibility with all PyTorch operations and optimizers.
- Automated gradient manipulation through PyTorch hooks.
- Simple transformation of PyTorch modules to HAT modules with a single line of code.
- Out-of-the-box HAT networks integrated with [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models).

## Quick Start

### Installation

To install via pip:

```bash
pip install hat-cl
```

Or, if you are using poetry:

```bash
poetry add hat-cl
```

### Basic Usage

To use HAT modules, swap generic PyTorch modules for their HAT counterparts (for instance, replace `torch.nn.Linear` with `hat.modules.HATLinear`. More examples in [Modules](#modules)). HAT modules process `hat.HATPayload` instances as input and output, containing tensor, task ID, and other HAT-mechanism essential variables.

Here's a simple 2-layer MLP example:

```python3
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from hat import HATPayload, HATConfig
from hat.modules import HATLinear


hat_config = HATConfig(num_tasks=5)

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = HATLinear(input_dim, hidden_dim, hat_config)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = HATLinear(hidden_dim, output_dim, hat_config)
        
    def forward(self, x: HATPayload):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        # You can still pass the payload to the non-HAT modules like this
        x = x.forward_by(self.relu)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x
    
    
mlp = MLP(input_dim=128, hidden_dim=32, output_dim=2)

input_payload = HATPayload(torch.rand(10, 128), task_id=0, mask_scale=10.0)
output_payload = mlp(input_payload)
output_data = output_payload.data
```

With these steps, you've created a 2-layer MLP with the HAT mechanism and successfully conducted a forward pass through the model. 
Just like any other PyTorch modules, it's ready to be trained, evaluated, and moreâ€”all under-the-hood operations are handled by the HAT modules.

Additionally, HAT-CL provides ready-to-use HAT networks with timm integration. Creating a HAT model is as simple as creating any other [timm](www.github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) model:

```python3
import timm
import hat.timm_models  # This line is necessary to register the HAT models to timm
from hat import HATConfig

hat_config = HATConfig(num_tasks=5)
hat_resnet18 = timm.create_model('hat_resnet18', hat_config=hat_config)
```

## Limitations

HAT-CL, while designed for broad compatibility with PyTorch, faces some constraints due to the inherent characteristics of the HAT mechanism:

- **Optimizer Re-initialization**: We recommend refreshing the optimizer state after each task to avoid momentum carryover from prior tasks. This can be easily done by re-initializing the optimizer.
- **Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)**: Weight decay isn't compatible with HAT due to its gradient altering process, which can interfere with parameters meant to be blocked by the HAT mechanism and cause potential forgetting. This includes the `weight_decay` optimizer parameter, and any optimizer using weight decay, such as AdamW.
